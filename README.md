This repository was forked from [https://github.com/Cwarcup/personal-blog.git](https://github.com/Cwarcup/personal-blog.git) by Curtis Warcup. It serves as the onboarding project for Lovelytics at UTMIST, aimed at helping newcomers familiarize themselves with **React** and **TailwindCSS** by creating a useful project they can showcase.

## Project Overview

## Features

- **High Performance**: Lightweight, optimized for speed and mobile view
- **SEO Optimized** with RSS feeds, sitemaps, and more
- **Flexible Content Management** using Markdown with JSX support via [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
